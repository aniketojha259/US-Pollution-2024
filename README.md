Project Overview
This project, Air Quality Analysis in the United States (2000-2022), provides a comprehensive look at pollution levels and trends across the United States, focusing on key pollutants. Using this analysis, we aim to develop insights and strategies for mitigating air pollution and improving public health.

Business Problem Statement
With increasing concerns over air quality and environmental health, this project seeks to analyze pollution data to inform environmental policies and health advisories. Understanding the fluctuations and impacts of pollutants such as Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Ozone (O3) across the United States is crucial to mitigating pollution and its health impacts.

Dataset Description
Scope: The dataset spans from 2000 to 2022 and includes key air pollutants: NO2, SO2, CO, and O3.
Size: Approximately 647,251 observations across 21 columns.
Primary Source: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
Additional Contributors: Kagglers BrendaSo and ANGELA KIM
Purpose: Enables comprehensive analysis of air quality trends, pollution levels, and environmental health studies.

Introduction to the Dataset
The dataset on Kaggle offers detailed insights into air quality across the United States, capturing trends and fluctuations in levels of NO2, SO2, CO, and O3 from 2000 to 2022. This data, sourced from the U.S. EPA and enhanced by contributors BrendaSo and ANGELA KIM, is well-suited for research into air quality trends, health impact assessments, and policy development.

Self-Analysis and Problem Identification
Task Overview
In this project phase, we conduct a comprehensive self-analysis of the dataset to guide our project's direction. This involves identifying specific problem statements that reflect key issues, challenges, or areas for improvement.

MECE Breakdown
Using the MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) framework, we divide the dataset into distinct, non-overlapping categories, covering:

Temporal Trends: Variations over time (daily, monthly, yearly)
Geographic Trends: Differences across states, counties, and cities
Pollutant-Specific Analysis: Each pollutant's concentration and impact
Air Quality Index (AQI): Health implications of different AQI levels
Problem Statement Formulation
Here are 15 sample problem statements generated from the MECE analysis:

Identify regions with the highest NO2 concentrations over time.
Analyze seasonal variations in CO levels across the U.S.
Determine the correlation between SO2 levels and industrial activity by region.
Assess trends in O3 levels in urban vs. rural areas.
Investigate the relationship between AQI levels and respiratory health indicators.
Compare the effects of air pollutants across different age demographics.
Evaluate the efficacy of previous pollution mitigation policies.
Study the relationship between temperature fluctuations and O3 levels.
Identify periods of significant increase in pollutant levels for SO2 and NO2.
Develop an alert system based on AQI thresholds for public health advisories.
Map areas with consistently high CO AQI readings.
Assess the effectiveness of regional pollution control measures over time.
Explore how natural events (e.g., wildfires) impact NO2 and SO2 levels.
Study the impact of pollutant levels on local wildlife and plant health.
Identify long-term trends in pollution reduction or increase for each pollutant.
Submission Guidelines
All analysis, breakdown, and problem statements are compiled into a document for project submission, ensuring alignment with the dataset characteristics.

Evaluation Criteria
Clarity and Depth: Detailed breakdown using the MECE framework
Quality of Problem Statements: Diversity and specificity of statements
Alignment with Dataset: Relevance to the datasetâ€™s contents and potential for improvement
