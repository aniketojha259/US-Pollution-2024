**Data Tracker Pollution (US-2024)**
**Project Overview**
This project, Air Quality Analysis in the United States (2000-2022), provides a comprehensive look at pollution levels and trends across the U.S., focusing on pollutants such as Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Ozone (O3). Using this analysis, we aim to develop insights and strategies for mitigating air pollution and improving public health.

**Business Problem Statement**
With increasing concerns over air quality and environmental health, this project seeks to analyze pollution data to inform environmental policies and health advisories. Understanding the fluctuations and impacts of pollutants like NO2, SO2, CO, and O3 across the United States is crucial to mitigating pollution and its health impacts.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset covers key air pollutants—NO2, SO2, CO, and O3—from 2000 to 2022 and includes approximately 647,251 observations across 21 columns. Sourced primarily from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with contributions from Kaggle users BrendaSo and ANGELA KIM, this dataset supports an in-depth analysis of air quality trends and their implications on public health and the environment.

**Data Dictionary**
The dataset includes the following key fields:

**Date:** Date of data collection
**Address:** Collection location
**State:** U.S. state of collection
**County:** County of data collection
**City:** City of data collection
**O3 Mean:** Average daily Ozone level
**CO Mean:** Average daily Carbon Monoxide level
**SO2 Mean:** Average daily Sulphur Dioxide level
**NO2 Mean:** Average daily Nitrogen Dioxide level Additional fields include maximum values and AQI levels for each pollutant, capturing their highest daily readings and health index scores.
**Introduction to the Dataset**
This dataset, available on Kaggle, offers insights into air quality trends across the United States from 2000 to 2022, covering pollutants like NO2, SO2, CO, and O3. The U.S. EPA sourced the data, which was further enhanced by Kaggle users BrendaSo and ANGELA KIM, and it is suited for analyzing air quality trends, assessing health impacts, and guiding policy development.

**Self-Analysis and Problem Identification**
For this project phase, we conduct a self-analysis using the MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) framework. This involves identifying distinct categories within the dataset, such as temporal trends, geographic differences, pollutant-specific variations, and health impacts via the AQI. Based on these categories, we crafted 15 problem statements addressing diverse aspects, like high NO2 regions, seasonal CO variations, and O3 trends in urban vs. rural areas.

**Submission Guidelines**
All analysis, including the MECE breakdown and problem statements, should be compiled into a single document for submission. This document must be labeled with the project title and your name, and submitted via the provided link.

Evaluation Criteria
Submissions will be evaluated based on the clarity and depth of analysis, the relevance and quality of problem statements, and alignment with the dataset’s contents. Visuals like charts or graphs are encouraged for added clarity.
